# Viola-Jones-Framework
The <b>Violaâ€“Jones object detection framework</b>, developed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001, is a pioneering machine learning algorithm specifically designed for rapid and accurate object detection. It was motivated primarily by the problem of face detection, although it can be adapted to the detection of other object classes.
