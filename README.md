# Viola-Jones-Framework
The <b>Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework</b>, developed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001, is an innovative machine learning algorithm specifically designed for fast, accurate face detection. It was primarily motivated by the problem of face detection, although it can be adapted to detect other classes of objects. Training the framework is relatively slow, but it enables objects to be detected quickly and accurately. In fact, it can detect human faces very effectively, and in real time.

Violaâ€“Jones is essentially a boosted feature learning algorithm trained by running a modified AdaBoost algorithm on Haar feature classifiers to find a sequence of classifiers <i>f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>, ..., f<sub>n</sub></i>. Haar feature classifiers, while simple, allow for very fast computation. The modified AdaBoost algorithm constructs a strong classifier by combining many weak classifiers, enabling accurate and efficient object detection.

The framework consists of several key components that work together to achieve efficient and accurate object detection:
<ol>
  <li>Selecting Haar-like features</li>
  <li>Creating an Integral image</li>
  <li>Running AdaBoost training</li>
  <li>Creating classifier cascades</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Selecting Haar-like features</h3>
Haar-like features, named for their similarity to 2D Haar wavelets, are essential components of the Viola-Jones object detection algorithm. These features use simple rectangular patterns to detect structural components of objects such as edges, lines, and textures. Applied to various sub-windows of the image, they evaluate the presence of specific patterns crucial for object recognition. 
There are many types of haar-like features. Some of them are:
<ul>
<li>Edge features</li>
<li>Line features</li>
<li>Center features</li>
<li>Four rectangle features</li>
</ul>
